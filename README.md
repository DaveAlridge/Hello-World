# Hello-World
Hey World! This is my first branch in my first main branch in my first repository :D
This readme is just to remember the learning plan I've proposed for myself:
Learn Git Basics
Learn how to commit to git via command line/text editor
Learn how to setup Streamlit
End goal: host GME daily open/close checker via Streamlit.
