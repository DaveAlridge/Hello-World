# Welcome to my home page
Hey World! This is my first file in the first main branch of my first repository :D
This readme is just to remember the learning plan I've proposed for myself:
* Learn Git Basics (*ongoing*)
* Learn how to commit to git via command line/text editor (*planned*)
* Learn how to setup Flask. Using [Corey's guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo), currently.
End goal: host GME daily open/close checker/blog page/ whatever I wanna :D
